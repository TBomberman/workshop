# Real Estate Price Analysis Algorithm

This project computes average real estate prices based on property metadata such as number of rooms, location, property type, and bathrooms ‚Äî and now includes **time-based filtering**, showing how the algorithm has evolved from its original version.

---

## üöÄ Improvements Over the Original Version

### ‚úÖ Original Capabilities
- Fetches property listings from a remote JSON endpoint.
- Computes **average price by number of rooms**.
- Outputs results to a JSON file.

---

### üîß New Features Added

#### 1. üìç **Average Price by Zone**
Groups prices by the `zone` field and calculates average prices per geographic location.

#### 2. üè† **Average Price by Property Type**
Includes categorization by `Apartment`, `Villa`, `Townhouse`, etc., using the `type` field.

#### 3. üöø **Average Price by Bathrooms**
Adds analysis by `bathroomsNo` to assess pricing for different property sizes.

#### 4. üïí **Average Price by Date Range**
NEW feature that adds **temporal filtering**:
- **Last 1 Month**
- **Last 3 Months**
- **Last 6 Months**

This allows tracking of **market trends** over time, using the `created` timestamp in the dataset.
